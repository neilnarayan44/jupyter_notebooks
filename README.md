# jupyter_notebooks

This Github public repository contains all the code used in the experiment. There are four Jupyter notebooks in this repository, each one of them corresponding
to the four methods used to map brain microstructure. The notebooks are as follows:

1. Ball & Stick (ALL voxels) - this refers to Dmipy's standard ball and stick model which was fitted to all voxels of the MRI data.
2. Relaxed Ball and Stick (ALL voxels) - this refers to the novel relaxed ball and stick model which was fitted to all voxels of the MRI data.
3. Random Forest Relaxed Ball and Stick - this refers to the random forest regressor being used to fit the relaxed ball and stick model to the MRI data.
4. MLP Relaxed Ball and Stick - this refers to the MLP regressor being used to fit the relaxed ball and stick model to the MRI data.
